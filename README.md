### Hi, I'm Huu (SteLe13) ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of the decentralized world.

My journey into technology is fueled by a deep fascination with blockchain's potential to empower individuals. I believe everyone has a unique contribution to make, and I'm here to build the tools that make it possible. As a passionate advocate for DeFi and DeSci, I am committed to being a lifelong learner in this space.

I am currently focused on gaining as much hands-on experience as possible. My learning is centered around the core technologies of dApp development:

- **Smart Contract Languages:** Solidity, Move
- **Backend & Tooling:** Node.js

I am actively seeking a team where I can contribute my energy, learn from experienced developers, and grow into a key member of a long-term project. I am a quick study, a dedicated team player, and ready to deploy my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

- ðŸŒ± My goal is to absorb knowledge and contribute to meaningful open-source or professional projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for mentorship and opportunities to prove my skills.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/huuforcrypto) or [Email](taihl.work@gmail.com).
